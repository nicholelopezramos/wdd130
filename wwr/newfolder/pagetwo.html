        <h1>Why Choose A Soy Wax Candle? The Benefits of Soy Wax </h1>
        <p>When it comes to shopping for candles, the scent and aroma shouldnt be the only factor to consider.  Candles can be made out of a variety of different waxes, with each wax having different properties that affect the performance.  Candles can be made from paraffin wax, soy wax, palm wax, and granulated wax just to name a few.  The Candle Studio uses 100% soy wax for all of our candles and thats just one of our secrets that sets our products apart from the rest!</p>

        <h1>What is soy wax?</h1>
        <p>Soy wax is a 100% natural wax derived from the vegetable soybeans.  Soybeans are one of the major agriculture crops grown in the United States, behind only corn.  Most of the worlds soybeans are grown and harvested close to home for us in the Midwestern United States.  In fact, Ohio is the 6th leading top soybean producing state in the U.S. After the beans are harvested, they are then cleaned, cracked, de-hulled and rolled into flakes.  Soybean oil is extracted from the flakes and the leftover flakes are used for animal feed. </p>

        <h1>Why choose soy wax?</h1>
        <p>Soy wax is made from environmentally friendly, renewable resources; whereas classic paraffin wax is made from petroleum and is non-renewable.  Not only are there “green” advantages to choosing soy wax over a different type of candle wax, but soy wax also burns slower than paraffin wax, meaning you get a candle that lasts longer.  While all candles emit some black soot while burning, candles made from soy wax burns cleaner and results in less soot.  Another reason to choose soy wax when it comes to candles is the fact that soy wax is an excellent fragrance carrier that does not require chemical amplifiers.  The result is a well-balanced true to scent candle.  </p>
