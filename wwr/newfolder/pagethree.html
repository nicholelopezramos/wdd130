        <h1> Customers Feedback</h1>
        <h3>These candles are EXCELLENT... AWESOME... FANTASTIC!!!! They truly do smell like the real deal! I had a custom order created for a wedding and she did not disappoint. I also requested a candle she did not have listed, leather, and boy was that the BEST leather candle ever!! The scents from the candles just take over the entire house and it is just amazing! I know where I will be doing my candle shopping from now on =] I just wish they came in bigger jars/tins so the awesomeness could last longer.</h3>

        <h3>Big b-day coming up and i wanted to put together a great party bag for my wonderful lifelong girlfriends that will be celebrating me on a five day cruise-this candle (50 Cabernet Sauvignon candle tins) is a perfect addition to the bag! Smells divine! Great packaging and Emerald was a doll to work with!!! I have passed her information along and will order again in the future for sure!</h3>

        <h3>From the packaging it arrived in to the enrapturing aroma, the pumpkin pie candle pie I ordered from Gourmet Candles was everything I could've wanted and more! The product arrived just as expected, very quickly, and in exceptional condition. Great care was taken to ensure the candle was not damaged in any way whatsoever. The scent from the candle is absolutely perfect, and it is unlike any pumpkin pie fragrance you can find in a chain candle store. It has me wanting to bake a real pumpkin pie to eat this week! The seller also worked with me on the shipping cost and was able to knock it down significantly since I was just ordering the one pie. The customer service I received was personalized, effective, and fantastic! Thank you so much, Gourmet Candle, for your phenomenal product; I cannot wait to order from you again soon!</h3>
