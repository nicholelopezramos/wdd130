        <h3>These candles are EXCELLENT... AWESOME... FANTASTIC!!!! They truly do smell like the real deal! I had a custom order created for a wedding and she did not disappoint. I also requested a candle she did not have listed, leather, and boy was that the BEST leather candle ever!! The scents from the candles just take over the entire house and it is just amazing! I know where I will be doing my candle shopping from now on =] I just wish they came in bigger jars/tins so the awesomeness could last longer.</h3>

        <h3>Big b-day coming up and i wanted to put together a great party bag for my wonderful lifelong girlfriends that will be celebrating me on a five day cruise-this candle (50 Cabernet Sauvignon candle tins) is a perfect addition to the bag! Smells divine! Great packaging and Emerald was a doll to work with!!! I have passed her information along and will order again in the future for sure!</h3>
